# Project-1 - Random-Quote
This is a project assigned through the Treehouse online tech degree for unit 1.
To begin, we were given all of the project files, with the CSS and index.html file written for us already.
The JavaScript file, however, only held a few comments with instructions. All of the work in the script.js
file is my own work and an example of the skills I've learned from Treehouse.
